            <h2>Rust News</h2>
             <p>After 10 years survival game Rust is finally getting backpacks, but pets 'will not be released this year'
                "How do I craft a backpack?" is typically the fifth question I ask when starting
                a new survival game, following "How do I craft an axe?" and "Where can I find
                water?" and "How do I make a campfire?" and the all-important "What the hell was
                that noise?".
                Rust dev finally adds highly requested backpacks, says pets are coming
                Rust isn't going to die out any time soon, after going strong for well over a
                decade now. Facepunch Studios' unique multiplayer survival game has all the
                essentials to make for a challenging, chaotic experience and will only continue
                to have more fun features as the developer now reveals a variety of other
                upcoming additions to Rust's content. Fans have asked for both backpacks and
                pets for a while now, and we now know we'll see both drop in updates.           
                Rust 2 confirmed, but it "definitely won't be a Unity game"
                Rust downtime "beyond our control," developer tells Valve
                SURVIVING A DECADE
                <h1>10 YEARS OF RUST</h1>Servers are now wiped and Santa is packing up and
                clearing out the bodies, but we hope you enjoyed the Holiday Season. We're
                getting back to work after a couple of weeks off, which is why this blog is
                lighter than usual, but we're looking forward to the journey ahead in 2024! This
                year, we celebrated Rust's 10th Birthday, which has been an incredible journey.
                Rust is continuing to see year-on-year growth and for a 10 year old game, that's
                a rather impressive feat. At a glance, here are some key gameplay features we
                added in 2023: [list] [] Industrial system [] Drones [] RF Detonated C4 []
                Security Camera [] Player controlled turrets [] Pings [] Double horse saddle
                [] Missile silo monument [] Wipe event [] Building skins [] Sleeping bag
                limits [] Building upgrade effects [] Water refresh [] Tugboat [] Ferry
                Terminal monument [] Wounded info [] Chat emoji [] Attack helicopter []
                Homing missile launcher [] Parachutes [] Armored hot-air balloon [] Above and
                below rail linking [] Underground train signals [] M4 shotgun [/list]
                Alongside a metric ton of improvements. Rust continues to be a labour of love
                from all of us at Facepunch, and we couldn't have done it without your passion
                and feedback. Rust has evolved around player feedback. It's not the game we
                initially set out to develop, but it's a game we're incredibly proud and
                passionate about to keep developing. Thank you for being an integral part of
                this incredible journey</p>
